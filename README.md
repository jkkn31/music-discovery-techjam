# Music Discovery for TikTok

## Abstract

In today's digital age, aspiring musicians face significant challenges in gaining visibility and recognition for their work. This document proposes innovative strategies to enhance exposure and engagement for new artists on TikTok, a leading platform for content creation and music discovery. The plan outlined focuses on leveraging TikTok's existing features and introducing novel approaches to foster a vibrant artist-fan community.

## Introduction

The explosive growth of social media platforms has revolutionized the way music is discovered and consumed, offering both opportunities and challenges for aspiring musicians. Among these platforms, TikTok has emerged as a powerhouse for viral content and music promotion, yet many talented artists struggle to break through the noise and gain visibility.

### Challenges

- **Limited Exposure**: Despite TikTok's vast user base, many new artists find it difficult to gain traction.
